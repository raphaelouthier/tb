TODO determine how to generate a coherent sequence of volume updates to test the lv1 lib.

TODO we must support order data with non-increasing time
	-> itb is OK but search must be updated :
		-> to search between [stt, end] :
           - start at stt - 1
		   - increment until stt is reached.
		   - iterate while end + 1 is reached or end.
    - update testbench to have every other time be equal
      to the other.
	-> test that the search function returns the _proper_block and element.

TODO when orderbook reconstruction lib is done, determine
the number of price ticks to contains in the per-tb_stg_blk
orderbook snapshot.

TODO lv1 storage interface : generate the per-block orderbook snapshot.

TODO test the lv1 storage interface by adding a storage step in the existing lv1 interface
	-> store data, and use the storage API to load it in the history and test the result.
