/*
 * The level 1 library provides ways to 
 * represent and operate on level 1 data.
 *
 * It is designed around the following use case : 
 * - fast incorporation and storage of burst of level 1
 *   events read from storage.
 * - determination of a current time.
 * - efficient generation and update of a time x tick-level
 *   indexed heatmap of events prior to the current time.
 * - efficient generation and update of two time-indexed
 *   bid-ask tick curves following the current time.
 *
 * The heatmap has the following characteristics :
 * - 0 : fixed size : the image generated has a fixed
 *   height and width, and as a consequence, only represents
 *   a fraction of time x tick of the orderbook.
 * - 1 : fixed time grid : each pixel column occupies a time
 *   range in the form of [start + K * delta, start + (K + 1) * delta[,
 *   K being an integer, and start and delta being two construction-time
 *   constants.
 * - 2 : non-tick-gathering : each pixel row represents a
 *   single tick level. No aggregation is made accross tick
 *   levels.
 * - 3 : synchronous re-anchoring : the heatmap must
 *   represent a relevant orderbook fraction. Consequence
 *   of 1 is that we only re-anchor horizontally once every
 *   delta.
 *   We have two choices for the vertical re-anchoring :
 *   - re-anchor at every event processing.
 *   - re-anchor only when we re-anchor horizontally.
 *   The first would be exact but would prevent us from
 *   reusing the previous image generations which greatly
 *   increases the processing time.
 *   The current choice is to re-anchor the time and
 *   tick-levels differences synchronously to maximize
 *   the reuse of previously generated data.
 *   It relies on the assumption that the reference tick
 *   does not vary significantly in a single delta.
 *
 * The bid-ask tick curves have the following characteristics :
 * - time-indexed, with same delta as heatmap.
 * - fixed size : the curves are mono-dimensional
 *   arrays with a fixed number of elements.
 *
 * The following optimizations are made :
 * - monotonic read : events can only be read in the
 *   increasing time direction, so that past indexed data
 *   is never updated.
 *
 * The heatmap and bid-ask curves are time-indexed.
 * Though, since they :
 * - group times in a cell of the width of
 *   1x the time resolution; and
 * - are re-anchored every time the current time increases
 *   enough
 * it is convenient to index their cells on a metric
 * derived from the time, the absolute index (aid), 
 * computed from the time and time resolution by :
 * aid = (u64) ((u64) time / (u64) resolution).
 * A reanchoring always does a shift of an integer > 0
 * number of aids.
